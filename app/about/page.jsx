            With the help of students from local high schools, the event aims to
            raise awareness about the importance of sustainability in the
            clothing industry, the pitfalls of fast fashion, and the importance
            of ethical labor practices. This will be done through engaging
            informational displays, and a runway show that features students
            modeling &quot;Quiet Luxury&quot; looks from sustainable brands.
            Funds raised will help My New Red Shoes to deliver programs that
            assist Bay Area families facing financial hardship.
